**Music**—This has been a very quiet year for me. Even though I released three new albums—[When The Satellite Fell][5], [Chasing My Ghost][6], and [The Illusion of Progress][7] (the most I’ve ever done in a single year)—there has been hardly any discussions or promotion for them. Most of this music was made prior to 2020. *Ghost* and *Progress* were recorded last year, then released in February and June. *Satellite* was recorded this year in March, and then released in September.

---- 

**Photos**—There’s a [photoblog][8] for each month. Pictures taken with an iPhone, telling my story throughout the year.

---- 

**Morning Coffee**—A weekly newsletter. It's simple: if you write your email address [here][9], my words will reach you again.

---- 

**Membership**—[Choose][10] what you pay. Whatever amount you choose will help fund the website and all the things I create.

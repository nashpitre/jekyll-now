**Music**—This has been a very quiet year for me. Even though I released three new albums—[When The Satellite Fell][4], [Chasing My Ghost][5], and [The Illusion of Progress][6] (the most I’ve ever done in a single year)—there has been hardly any discussions or promotion for them. Most of this music was made prior to 2020. *Ghost* and *Progress* were recorded last year, then released in February and June. *Satellite* was recorded this year in March, and then released in September.

**Membership**—[Choose][8] what you pay. Whatever amount you choose will help fund the website and all the things I create.

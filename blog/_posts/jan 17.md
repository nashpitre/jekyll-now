title: Monthly Recap (January 2017)

January was a nice start to the year for me. In terms of health, mood, and productivity, everything has been consistent. My schedule was flexible, giving me a lot of time to write, attend [church][1], play [basketball][2], and watch lot of [Netflix][3]â€”all of which kept me at peace.

## Featured

Productivity wise, I wrote a few big posts:

- [10 Reasons Why 2016 Was My Favorite][4]
- [Allbirds Wool Runners: 8 Months Later (Review)][5]
- [My Two-Year Anniversary at Cross Church][6]
- [Rest In Peace, Randal][7]
- [Guest Posts][8]

My [2016][9] writeup is one of the biggest posts I've ever worked on, and as the first post of the year, it sets the bar high for me. I reviewed my favorite shoes, the [Allbirds][10], which I wore every day for eight months. January 28th made [two years][11] that I've been going to Cross Church, so I wrote about how much those two years have meant to me. My friend Randal [passed away][12] last week, and I wrote about how he impacted my life. I'm prepping for my second season of Guest Posts, so I [wrote about last season][13] and invited everyone to join me with Season Two.

## Money

I started selling two new shirts on my site, from [The Impact Collection][14]. **Randal Strong** and **Hero** are the first two from this collection, and the other two will be released in February.

Donations to the site were steady, and each donation was used to buy [\#RandalStrong][15] shirts to give away, helping Randal's family with upcoming expenses.

## Photos

I spent some time testing out the iPhone 7 Plus's camera, and [Portrait Mode][16] is becoming something I constantly use.

## Around The Web

John Mayer released [Wave One][17] of his new album, The Search For Everything. A new wave will come out each month until the album is completely out.

Evan Puschak released two new videos: [The Prestige: Hiding In Plain Sight][18] and [Frank Ocean: Musical Identity][19], both are important watches to me.

Maxamillion711 released a new Russell Westbrook video, called [No Mercy][20]. It seems like his videos keep getting better.

MKBHD released an iPhone 7 review, titled [4 Months Later][21]. He explained why this phone is so good, and what sets it apart from other phones.

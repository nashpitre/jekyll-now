# Scratched Cornea: Productivity Life Hack

![][image-1]

A few days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night to take my contacts out. When I did that, the [contact scratched my cornea][1], and I couldn't see out of that eye. I spent the following morning at the doctor, getting the treatment and instructions to rest it (not go into sunlight). Those $100 eye drops that were prescribed to me helped the situation. I still have blurry vision in the left eye, with a follow-up next week, but at least there's no more pain. During that "rest" time (and since I was in the house and couldn't do anything else), I was able to knock out a few projects that were waiting on me.

- I built out my [OmniFocus][2] task manager
- I recorded a [new song][3] for the upcoming album
- I helped launch [Janea's website][4]
- I released a big [guest post][5] on my website
- I also took lots of naps in between all of these projects

This is how you turn a bad thing into a good thing. I'm back at work feeling more motivated and productive than ever.

Side note: My new glasses from Warby Parker came in today, a day early, which lets me know that I donâ€™t need my contacts for awhile.

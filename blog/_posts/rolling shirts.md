# Rolling Shirts and Letting Go of Hangers

![][image-1]

When I got home from work last night, my plan was to relax and watch some movies and just take it easy, since I never get the chance to. But then I stumbled upon [this video][1].

I immediately turned the lights on, dragged my nightstand near the television, grabbed all of my hanged clothes, and within 20 seconds of getting excited about this idea, I was rolling my  wardrobe and making a pile of hangers. (Also watched [this video][2] during folding everything.)

How cool is it that hangers is something I've had my entire life, and now I can let them go.

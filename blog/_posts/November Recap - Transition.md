title: "November Recap: A Month of Transition"
---

[Derek Sivers][1]:

> Life can be improved by adding, or by subtracting. The world pushes you to add, because that benefits them. But the secret is to focus on subtracting.

## Cartoon Faces

There’s cartoon faces all around me now. I think I’ve created a monster. At the bottom of every blog post, you’ll see the flashing lights of my face. It’s randomly cycling through all the different versions I’ve made. And I can’t stop making them. If you'd like to make your own version to add to that cycle, [download][2] the color sheet, add your skills to it, then send it back. I made a [big page][3] that features tons of different products to purchase. I also made a [Christmas mug][4].

## Share Your Gifts

This Apple [commercial][5] is heartfelt and worth your time.

## Moving

I spent the month in transition, [moving][7] from Thibodaux back to Houma. During that time, I became a master of bartering. I downsized all my possessions to the bare minimum, a very fun experiment.

## Rocky

All five [Rocky][8] films are now free to watch on YouTube.

## 100 Jacket Mission

The [100 Jacket Mission][9] kicked of again for another year. This year is dedicated to a friend that passed away, Sarah Pell. The focus will be on kid’s jackets. There’s so many kids that need a jacket in our area. It’s sad. I’m hoping the message spreads far enough to make a huge impact on those in need.

## The Lion King

[The Lion King Teaser Trailer][10] was released. I keep watching it over and over.

## iPad Pro and GoPro

I bought the new iPad Pro. I also bought a GoPro. I’ve been getting some serious work done with the two. That GoPro and that iPad has been producing a bunch of videos: For My Brother [001][12] and [002][13], as well as [Walk In The Light][14].

## Thanksgiving

[Thanksgiving][15] was beautiful. It’s always special when I get to spend time with all of my siblings. Wish we could do it more.

## Creative Minds

[Creative Minds: November][16] just wrapped up.

## Relationship

I met someone. She’s pretty cool.

title: Good Morning, 5am
---

I'm not a morning person, but I want to be. My goal is to wake up every morning at 5am, to run, drink coffee, write, shower, and then go to work. This is what I'd consider a perfect morning, but it takes a lot of dedication to create these habits. I did it this morning, and I did it for maybe 30% of 2016, but I want to be more consistent.

I bought a 2017 planner two months ago (here's the [link][1] to the planner if you'd like one too), and today was the first day on that planner. I made a small list of things I want to accomplish today, I have a few more tasks to do, but I'm close to finishing everything already, and it's only 8am. I'm writing this while drinking my second cup of coffee at Downtown Jeaux, and while listening to the new [Run The Jewels 3][2] album in my [AirPods][3]. I'm saying this because those cups of coffee, that planner, that new album, and those AirPods help motivate me, pushing me to want to wake up early and be productive. Consider these my tools for the morning. Your tools might look different, but having tools, to me at least, is the only way to feel motivated when climbing out of bed.

When my alarm went off, I slowly stood up, made the bed, emptied out my [backpack][4] completely, and then reloaded it with everything I'll need for the day. As I walked out of the house, with music playing in my ears, I was ready for a productive day. When I'm done writing this, I'll put everything back in my bag, and before getting in my car, I'll go for a 30-minute run to fill up the exercise ring on my [Watch][5].

To be healthy, to write, and to slowly become a morning person, I continue to  find ways to simplify the process and make it fun. Setting yourself up for success is the key. I know what it takes for me to have successful mornings, so I search for ways to recreate those patterns, as well as improve the process.

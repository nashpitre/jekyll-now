# October Recap

![][image-1]

October was a month of finding balance. Of being grounded. A lot of resting (everyone around me told me I didn’t have a choice). I spent a lot of time doing things that were out of my usual routine. Like serving at a women’s conference. Like riding a motorcycle in the rain like I’m Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible. Like being at the gym for 4 am workout sessions. Like preparing to be a basketball coach in the coming weeks. If your life is off, even by a little bit, challenge yourself to get out of that season as soon as possible, simply by trying new things. Switch things up. It’s your life, you can do anything you want. Here’s to November.

# Music Videos

I created two music videos this month. One was a brand new song, that was so therapeutic that I think nearly fixed every single thing I was dealing with in my heart. The other was just another layer to a finished album.

- [The Illusion of Progress][4]

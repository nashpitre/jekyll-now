# Membership

### Why become a [member][1]? To Invest.

The membership doesn’t give you any perks, discounts, or bonuses. It’s an investment. It’s for those that want to see me tell more stories. They want more albums, more videos, and more books. It’s for those that want the things I create to become my full-time job. They believe in me enough to become a member.

The [membership][2] is a yearly contribution to support all things created on nashp.com. There’s no pressure to join. If you feel like I’ve brought you enough value, then join. Otherwise, I’ll keep working.

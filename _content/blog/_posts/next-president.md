title: Thoughts On My Next President
---

![][image-1]

I'll start this by stating the obvious: my opinion is just my opinion. It has zero power, and shouldn't matter to you, especially if you're one of those people that thrive on political debates. I'm not the one to debate with. You'll lose—or win, depending on how you look at it, because I simply don't care enough to reply. So nothing to see here, move along. This post is just some words I typed on my iPhone.

With that being said, let's begin.

Hillary Clinton is in this position by default, with no competition, and her popularity increased when she became the alternative to Donald Trump. Pick your poison. Lose lose. 

Donald Trump, and basically this entire election, shows where we are as a society: loud and quick to react without anything thoughtful to say—and then those listening will react to that reaction, without anything thoughtful to say. The notion that because you're louder doesn't mean you win anything. It just means you haven't left any air in the room for anyone else to speak.

My president is supposed to be someone I look up to. Someone that I'm proud to stand behind. My president should have class. Instead, I look at both of these candidates like they're the villain in a superhero movie. I'm scared of them. I look at them like they're a joke, with zero sincerity.

I've always been the last one to judge a person. I try my best to see the good in someone, and even when the rest of the world is doubting them, I'm cheering them on, waiting for them to beat the odds. So I know there's a problem here when I'm judging these two the way I am.

To sum this up: I don't trust my next president. That statement is as scary as it gets.

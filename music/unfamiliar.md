There's an ongoing theme throughout these 8 songs. Things are happening. My surroundings are different. My perspective has changed. The people around me have changed. Even with all that I know, there are still so many unanswered questions. This is The Land of Unfamiliar.

# Is Anybody Out There

I made a video for the 4th song on the album. It's about helping other people. Those that are either less fortunate or going through a rough season in their life. ([Here's][1] the original Facebook post, from Chase Toups.)

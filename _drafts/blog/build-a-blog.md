There’s just a few things you’ll need to know about before starting:

- **[Markdown][1]** is how you’ll write. It’s simple rules and characters (syntax) that you’ll use to turn writing into actually blog posts.

- **[Dropbox][2]** is where your blogs will be stored. Create an account at [Dropbox.com][3] or through the Dropbox app.

- **[Blot][4]** is a blogging platform that turns a Dropbox folder into a website. Because of Blot, any text file or image added to Dropbox automatically becomes a blog post.

- **[Hover][5]** is what allows you to have a custom name, like nashp.com.

Just finished going on a motorcycle ride with Olivia for a few hours. Now back, flashing sd card to install Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi. Organized my Things app to structure all my tasks and projects. Planning to experiment with not using the iPad as much, and just use iPhone, more paper and pencil, and Kindle—as I prepare to sell iPad. It’ll be a fun experiment, as I rely on the iPad so much. Wonder how much do I *really* need it, compared to just being comfortable with it always being there.

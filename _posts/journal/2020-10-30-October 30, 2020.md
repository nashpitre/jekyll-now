Finishing up my work in Lake Charles for the week. Almost done. Then home for awhile.

Planning to sell iPad and Kindle Paperwhite. Planning for PlayStation 5 and a free Kindle Oasis.

Need to do my October photoblog this weekend.

Testing. No iPad. Just iPhone paired to my Keychron keyboard. iPhone is propped up on my desk. This seems like a great way to bypass needing a iPad to get long form writing done. iPhone and a keyboard. Simple. Thatâ€™s always the goal.

## Lyrics

This is Heaven. This is hell. This is Heaven. This is hell. When the satellite fell.

If I could get these thoughts out. Feels like I lost out. So many battles I fought now, I lost count. A lost child that found his way out of it. How did he? The route that he traveled was miles away. He saw the smoke and figured it was the right direction. Protection. The bodies were piled up like a mountain. He kept walking. The wisdom was self-taught. This music is brought to you by satellite signals with empty coordinates. The world was his orphanage. He kept walking with his Walkman. Bone Thugs and Harmony. He flipped the tape over, and hoped that it played over, and The double A batteries would last to the next shelter to help him. He was all by himself. A kid with a mission that was derailed by the military with mask, that scanned his face and told him he could pass. A distant future that resembles the past. He’s no different from you He’s just a few generations younger. The satellite above him let them know that he’s coming. Looking down from the stars. You can hear the sound of the war.

When the satellite fell. In a land of no return. The heart was involved, but now there’s no concern. It’s a soldiers journey. The training has made me ambivalent to feelings, and your emotions aren’t part of the mission. If I left you behind, I apologize, but you just weren’t part of the vision that I was given.

It’s hard to be Christian in a world full of sickness. In a world full of hypocrites, I love you anyway. My best attribute is forgiveness. All you see is division. What a beautiful world that we live in, I think to myself, as I refill my prescription. Anxiety inside of me is now more like a friendship that I live with. Thousands of words have been written, just Look at the blisters. Every sentence collectively together tell a story of a person with wisdom. It’s like we’re sitting by the fire reading scriptures, as you quietly listen.

There’s a war in the distance. How did we get here? I call on higher powers to help me out, because I’m just one person trying to figure it out. How to take what I’m thinking, and make it more. From the floor plan, to the door handle: the blueprint’s laid out. This is I what I prayed about, and now it came about. It was written.

When The Satellite Fell. That title was created before the isolation. Before the quarantine. Before the social distance. Prophetic the way that the world crashed and caved in, and everyone stayed in their house, and kept to themselves. I wrote that title months before any of this, then the story wrote itself.
